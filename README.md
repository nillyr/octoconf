positional arguments:
  {analyze,audit,misc}  Available Commands
    analyze             performs an analysis on an archive based on a checklist
    audit               performs an audit of the host based on a checklist
    misc                miscellaneous commands

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         print version and exit
  -d, --debug           debug output (verbose)
```

## Quick usage

- Create your checklist based on the template
- Check the correct translation into JSON using the hjson tool (`hjson -j checklist.hjon`)
- Recommended: Assess the potential negative impact of your checklist on a test environment
- Perform an audit on the current system or an analysis on a collection
  - The archive must have been made via the script that was produced by the script generation use case

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+

## Use cases description

### Script Generation

- Input: a checklist
- Output: a collection script

This use case allows to generate from a checklist passed in argument a collection script in the chosen language (see the list of supported languages in the help output). It is also possible to generate collection scripts for devices such as routers, switches, etc. The Epilog and Prolog parts of the script may need to be modified.

#### Examples

```bash
# Linux
octoreconf misc gen-script -c checklist.hjson -l bash -p linux -o linux-collection-script.sh
# macOS
octoreconf misc gen-script -c checklist.hjson -l bash -p mac -o mac-collection-script.sh
# Windows (Batch)
octoreconf misc gen-script -c checklist.hjson -l batch -p windows -o windows-collection-script.bat
# Windows (Powershell)
octoreconf misc gen-script -c checklist.hjson -l powershell -p windows -o windows-collection-script.ps1
```

### Audit

- Input: a checklist
- Output: an XLSX and a JSON file

This use case allows to execute all the specified commands from a checklist. The results of the "collection_cmd" will be present in output files. The output path is automatically determined by taking into account the name of the category and the file specified in the command.

After the execution of the commands, the results are verified taking into account the verification type requested.

Finally, an XLSX file is generated presenting the results graphically. A JSON file is also generated for later use.

#### Examples

```bash
# Launch the audit
octoreconf audit -c checklists.hjson -o ouput_dir/
# Launch the audit and specify the language to use in the output file (xlsx)
octoreconf audit -c checklists.hjson -o ouput_dir/ -l en
```

### Analyze

- Input: a checklist and an archive
- Output: an XLSX and a JSON file

This use case allows an analysis of the results of the checks based on a checklist.

**Important:** the archive must have been generated by the collection script derived from the checklist used for the analysis.

#### Examples

```bash
# (tag.gz format) Launch the analyze
octoreconf analyze -a archive.tar.gz -c checklist.hjson
# (tag.gz format) Launch the analyze and specify the language to use in the output file (xlsx)
octoreconf analyze -a archive.tar.gz -c checklist.hjson -l en
# (zip format) Launch the analyze
octoreconf analyze -a archive.zip -c checklist.hjson
# (zip format) Launch the analyze and specify the language to use in the output file (xlsx)
octoreconf analyze -a archive.zip -c checklist.hjson -l en
```

### Report Generation

- Input: a JSON file
- Output: an XLSX and a JSON file

This use case can be called automatically as a chain of other use cases or independently. When called independently, this use case takes as input a JSON file (the one produced by the other use cases) in order to (re)generate a file in XLSX format.

#### Examples

```bash
# Launch the report generation
octoreconf -d misc gen-report -i 20211006115003_results.json
# Launch the report generation and specify the language to use in the output file (xlsx)
octoreconf -d misc gen-report -i 20211006115003_results.json -l en
```
